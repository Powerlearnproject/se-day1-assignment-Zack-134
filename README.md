Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
  Software engineering refers to the application of engineering principles, methods and tools to develop and manage quality software products.
  Software engineering enables the creation of better quality software products/tech solutions.
  It also enhance collaboration team collaboration and customer satisfaction

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
   **Development of high level programming languages such as Fotran**: This resulted to the creation of reliable application solutions in software enginering
   **Structured Programming (1960sâ€“1970s)**: With emergence of High Level Programming languages, developers introduce the structured programming methodology for ease and faster development process.
   **The Advent of Agile Methodologies (2000s)**: Developers needed a cleaner and lean methodology for application development unlike the waterfall which was time consuming, thus the emergence of the agile methodology 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
   **Requirements**: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
   **Design**: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
   **Implementation**: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
   **Testing**: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
   **Deployment**: Releasing the software to users or customers.
   **Maintenance**: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
   **Waterfall**: in this, the phases that are to be involved in application are taken in a sequential approach. Used mainly when developing a large ifrastructure project where compliance is requared 
   **Agile**: this is an iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change. Used mainly when 
the project requirements are expected to change
   in summary **waterfall** methodology is a sequential model, that is used when the there is little expected changes to happen during the development time whereas **agile** is an iterative and incremental approach that tolerates changes if any, during the development process.
    
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
   **Software Developer**: They are responsible for designing, coding, testing, and debugging software applications
   **Quality Assurance Engineer**: There main role is to test software applications to identify defects and ensure they function as expected.
   **Project Manager**: They are responsible for planning, organizing, and managing resources to ensure successful project completion.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
   **Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)**: are softeware suites that provides comprehensive tools for writting, debuging and testing codes. examples include the VSCode and Eclipse 
   **Version Control Systems(VCS)**: Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members examples include Github and Jenkins

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
   **Keeping up with rapid technological advancements**: The software industry evolves rapidly, demanding continuous learning and adaptation.
   **Debugging complex systems**: Identifying and resolving issues in large, intricate software systems can be time-consuming and challenging
   **Tight deadlines and resource constraints**: Delivering high-quality software under pressure can be stressful and challenging

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
   **Unit Testing**: Individual components of the software are test at a time with an object to verify there functionallity
   **Integration Testing**: This aims at testing interactions between different software modules that make up the entire software.
   **System Testing**: The entire software system is tested as a complete product to verify that the system meets specified requirements and functions correctly.
   **Acceptance Testing**: Is a test to verify software's ability to meet the needs of end-users to determine if is acceptable for delivery.
    
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
  **Prompt engineering** is the process of crafting effective prompts to guide artificial intelligence models, to generate desired outputs.
  **Prompt engineering is crucial for several reasons**: Accuracy and Relevance of the output, and creative output

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
  **Vague Prompt**: Tell about Dogs. 
  This prompt is vague because it doesn't specify what kind of information the user is seeking. It could refer to dog breeds, dog care, dog behavior, or anything related to dogs

  **Improved Prompt**: Write a brief overview of the most popular dog breeds in Kenya, including their physical characteristics and temperament.
  This prompt is clear, specific, and concise. It specifies the desired information (dog breeds, physical characteristics, and temperament), the geographic location (Kenya), and the desired format
